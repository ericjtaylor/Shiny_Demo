Concept
========================================================

Purchasing an engagement ring is a stressful experience. Individuals are confronted with conflicting issues:

- Are they paying a fair price? (looking to minimize cost) 
- Are they buying something with enough "bling" factor? (need to spend a lot of money) 

These 2 things pull in opposite directions. This app is trying to reduce stress by providing answers to both of these questions.

How does it work?
========================================================

A simple linear model was fit on ggplot2's diamonds dataset, including interaction terms. It focuses on the 4 Cs of diamonds:

1. Carats
2. Cut
3. Color
4. Clarity

Users then simply enter in the 4 Cs of the diamond they are considering, and report is generated advising them on their purchase. An estimated price tells them if the store is **charging too much**. The percentile rank of the price confirms if **their budget is too cheap**.

Model Code
========================================================

The server calculation can be summarized as follows:


```r
    diamonds <- diamonds %>% select(price, carat, cut, color, clarity)
    model <- lm(price ~ .*., data=diamonds)
    result <- predict(model, input)
    
    output$hist = renderPlot({ggplot(diamonds, aes(price)) + geom_histogram() + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=result))})
    output$value = renderText({paste("This diamond is valued at an estimated $", round(result, 2), " USD.")})
    output$bling = renderText({paste("This diamond is more expensive than ", round(100*sum(diamonds$price<result) / nrow(diamonds), 2), "% of diamonds.")})
```

Is it Accurate?
========================================================

There is room for improvement, with some clear non-linear effects. This model is just a proof of concept, it can be further refined and enhanced.
